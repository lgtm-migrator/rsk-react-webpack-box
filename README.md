# RSK React Webpack Box

## Description

In this box you'll find a basic starter pack. It includes Truffle, React and Webpack.
The app was created with create-react-app and it can be customized with customize-cra.

This starter contains two main elements
- Truffle framework 
- React App (located at `app/` folder)

## Pre requisites

Install node or update 

Install node -> https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Update node -> npm update


## Unboxing

Run the unbox command

```bash
truffle unbox rsksmart/rsk-react-webpack-box
```

For simplicity, there is hook that is going to setup the environment and install all it's dependencies.

## Environment setup

### Description

This box comes with two environments
- Truffle environment (located at root folder)
- React environment (located at `/app`)

Each environment comes with a specific `package.json`, if you want to manage truffle `package.json` you simply run npm commands at root folder. For `app/package.json` you'll need to install and manage it with `yarn` package manager (because it's a create-react-app)

If you don't have `yarn` installed you can install it running 

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Truffle Environment setup

First ensure you are at the root folder and have truffle installed. 

If you don't have truffle installed you'll need to run this in order to install it.

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

To install truffle dependencies 

```bash
# At project root folder (I.E '../resk-react-webpack-box/')
npm install
```

Now, the only thing you'll need to do it's to create in the root directory a .env file and write your nemonic there

```
A_MNEMONIC="Write your seed words here"

```

In your `truffle-config.json` file import env variables 

```js
// truffle-config.json

const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');

// Require dotenv
require('dotenv').config();

//You should never deploy your mnemonic into production or you will lost your crypto!
const mnemonic = process.env.A_MNEMONIC;
//4) Make sure you add  togitignore the file .env 
//Put your mnemonic here, take care of this and don't deploy your mnemonic into production!
const mnemonic = 'A_MNEMONIC';
```

#### Using the truffle console

You can start a truffle console for any RSK network

```bash
# Console for Mainnet
truffle console --network mainnet

# Console forn Testnet
truffle console --network testnet
```

#### Migrating contracts

In order to migrate contracts to a specific network

```bash
# Migrate for Mainnet
truffle migrate --network mainnet

# Migrate for Testnet
truffle migrate --network testnet
```

### App environment setup

First install it's dependenices. Remember that you'll need to manage it with `yarn` package manager.

```bash
# At app folder (I.E '../resk-react-webpack-box/app')
yarn
```

Then you can run the `app/` with

```bash
# At app folder (I.E '../resk-react-webpack-box/app')
yarn start
```

**The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.**

#### Build

To build the `app/` run 

```bash
# At app folder (I.E '../resk-react-webpack-box/app')
yarn build
```



#### Comunicating with RSK network

[Web3 JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io) and [ethereumjs-tx](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-tx) have been bundled for comunicating with RSK network.

#### Customizing create-react-app default options

This app/ uses [customize-cra](https://github.com/arackaf/customize-cra) in order to customize webpack, babel and all default `create-react-app` options. 

You can customize it at `app/config-overrides.js`.

#### Code format with Prettier

This project is integrated with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for handling code format. You can format the `app/` runing 

```bash
# At app folder (I.E '../resk-react-webpack-box/app')
yarn lint
```

To define new rules or edit exsting ones, just edit `.prettierrc`

You can ignore files at `.prettierignore`
